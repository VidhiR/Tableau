How have movie genres changed over time?

From the analysis, I see the trend of growing public interest for action movies. The popularity and profit for Action genre has increased tremendously over the last 6-8years. Adventure and Fantasy genre has not been so profitable or popular for over a long period of time. Comedy, Drama and Crime are gaining the popularity. Science Fiction is not doing so good in the market. Animation movies started doing well in 2013 however, profit has been drastically decreasing since 2014.

Market growth for movies based on novels is not consistent except the year 2015 where profit was high, however, it is marginal to the profit growth of movies not based on novels. Overall market share profit of movies not based on novel is higher than the movies based on novel which is shown in the multiple plot.  


What genres movies are most targeted by Director James Cameron and which of his movie made the most revenue?

I came up with this question thinking of real world use case that a business or consumer in movie industry would come across. By raising this question, I am trying to address that who are popular director for specific genre and which was their biggest blockbuster. Sponsors would want to predict directorâ€™s success based on genre so that they can decide if they want to sponsor movies made by that director. 

The analysis of the bar chart clearly shows that Director James Cameron has mostly worked on Action movies which brought in the most profit. This was done by plotting the profit and the directors on a bar chart which showed all the directors with profit that they made. My focus was James Cameron, so excluding everyone else and adding genre in colors gave me the list of genres that he has worked on. And of all the genres, Action is the what brought in the most profit. The movie that made the most revenue is Avatar which is also an action movie.
